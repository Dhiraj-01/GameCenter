                        The n-puzzle is a classical problem for modelling algorithms
                        involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics for this
                        problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and
                        finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block
                        and its position in the goal configuration.

                        The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of
                        Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle
                        that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random
                        order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other
                        sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3
                        tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if
                        4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle
                        named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number
                        of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in
                        order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

                        The history of the Snake game goes back to the 1970's. However, it was the 1980's when the game
                        took on the look that we will be using. It was sold under numerous names and many platforms but
                        probably gained widespread recognition when it was shipped as standard on Nokia mobile phones in
                        the late 1990's.
                        <br> <br>
                        The game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by turning only left or right by
                        ninety degrees until you
                        manage to eat an apple. When you get the apple, the Snake grows an extra block or body segment.
                        <br> <br>
                        If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats himself the
                        game is over. The more apples the snake eats the higher the score.

                        Sudoku is a very popular game which consists only in numbers and logic. The long and interesting
                        history of the Sudoku is quite a puzzle in itself. Even though the name derives from the
                        Japanese language, consisting on the Japanese characters Su (meaning 'number') and Doku (meaning
                        'single') but it was not invented in Japan.
                        <br> <br>
                        It all begins with a Swiss genius, Leonard Euler, a mathematician who owns the credits of the
                        creation of the puzzle that we know as Sudoku. A brief and localized version of "Magic Squares"
                        appeared as a newspaper puzzle between about 1890 and 1920 in France, but it didn't gain any
                        kind of popularity. Than Sudoku Puzzle had its journey to America, where after 50 years the
                        puzzle was introduced by Howard Garnes in the American Dell magazine. The puzzle had its spread
                        over the Pacific to Japan and very soon it become a worldwide phenomenon.
                        <br> <br>
                        It is one of the few puzzles that can claim to be truly international by nature. It has no
                        cultural baggage and just needs a logical mind to solve it. That's why Sudoku is one of the most
                        famous and most frequent games distributed by magazines, newspaper and internet.
