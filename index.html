                        The n-puzzle is a classical problem for modelling algorithms
                        involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics for this
                        problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and
                        finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block
                        and its position in the goal configuration.

                        The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of
                        Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle
                        that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random
                        order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other
                            sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3
                            tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if
                            4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle
                            named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number
                            of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in
                            order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

                        Tic-Tac-Toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a
                        paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

                        The Tic Tac Toe is a great way to pass your free timewhether you're standing in a line or spending time with your kids.
                        Stop wasting paper and savetrees. Because of the simplicity of Tic Tac Toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teachingthe concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence.
